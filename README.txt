For better memorization, we suggest to use multiple repetitions with the help of different methods:

  	- Method of cards
 	- Tests from English to Ukrainian
  	- Tests from Ukrainian to English

	For a better result, we invite you to study 5 new words per day and practice them through exercises until 
complete memorization, only after that add five new words.
Repeat it every day and in a month you will learn 150 new words.
